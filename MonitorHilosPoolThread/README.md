### General Info
***
In this repository we perform the following exercise Starting from 30 "images" (arrays of 3800 * 2100) initialized with values ​​between 0 and 255, increase the value of each pixel by 10% without exceeding its maximum value (255) using a pool of threads that use at most half of the cores of our computer, and using a monitor for the process ensuring that there is no critical section.

We have two classes, monitor which will be in charge of processing the images and Pool which is in charge of storing all the procedures and methods.

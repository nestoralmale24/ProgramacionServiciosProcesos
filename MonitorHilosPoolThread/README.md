### General Info
***
In this repository we perform the following exercise Starting from 30 "images" (arrays of 3800 * 2100) initialized with values ​​between 0 and 255, increase the value of each pixel by 10% without exceeding its maximum value (255) using a pool of threads that use at most half of the cores of our computer, and using a monitor for the process ensuring that there is no critical section.
